# Crow

Crow is a single-page application to visualize bird migration as detected by weather radars. Makes use of the [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) toolkit, [D3](https://d3js.org/) and [BootstrapVue](https://bootstrap-vue.js.org/).

## Installation and development

```
npm install

Then commit and push, including the `docs` directory. GitHub pages will serve the site at <https://inbo.github.io/crow/>.

Next step: getModule doesn't work?
